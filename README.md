"Using Hawkes Processes to model infectious disease data. The aim is to be able to simulate from these data as well as extract useful insights on if the disease outbreaks were controlled or not, and what we can do to aid in their control and reduction. 
We use the Thinning algorithm to simulate and use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate parameters and thus fit new models.
Future aim: use these datasets to forecast and evaluate the models' predictive ability"
